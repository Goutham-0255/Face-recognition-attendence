# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Description
This Python project implements a facial recognition-based attendance system using the `face_recognition` and `OpenCV` libraries. The system captures video from a webcam, detects and recognizes faces, and logs attendance with timestamps in a CSV file.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Uses a webcam to capture video and detect faces in real-time.
- **Facial Recognition**: Compares faces in the video feed with pre-stored images of known individuals.
- **Attendance Logging**: Records the name and timestamp of recognized individuals in a daily CSV file.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays names and bounding boxes around recognized faces in the video feed.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for loading images and capturing video frames.

## Dependencies
- `face_recognition`: For facial recognition and encoding.
- `opencv-python`: For video capture and image processing.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `csv`: For logging attendance data.
- `datetime`: For timestamping attendance records.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   (https://github.com/Goutham-0255/Face-recognition-attendence.git)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd face_recognition_attendance
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Known Face Images**
   - Place images of known individuals in the `photos` directory.
   - Ensure images are named according to the individuals' names.

2. **Update File Paths**
   - Make sure the paths to images in the script match their location in the `photos` directory.

3. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   python face_recognition_attendance.py
   ```

4. **Stopping the Script**
   - Press 'q' to stop the script and end the session.

## Configuration
- **Image Paths**: Verify that the image file paths in the script correspond to the actual file locations.
- **CSV Logging**: The script generates a CSV file named with the current date to log attendance data.

## Notes
- **Lighting and Camera Quality**: Ensure proper lighting and use a high-quality webcam for best results.
- **File Paths**: Update image file names and paths in the script as needed.
